                <h2>Why PinteReach is so Important</h2>
                <p> Tired of looking through your search history to find that article that you need for work
                    or school? Pintereach can help anyone that gets lost in their research. It helps keep track of
                    the sources that help people with work, school, or hobbies and interests. We created 
                    PinteReach to make sure your articles are in a safe place and can be easy tracked. You can
                    categorize your articles if you have multiple interests or research topics and mark their importance!
                    With only a couple clicks, you can research without the stress!
                </p>

                <h2>A Little Background</h2>
                <p>Just a little over a week ago, we were tasked with making a very important application
                    that will change the way we research. Who doesn't get stressed when they research and
                    lose the valuable information? We found a way to make collecting articles much easier!
                    We are just like the other sites but a gazillion times better!
                </p>

                <h2>Looking to the Future!</h2>
                <p>The current version is great but we are looking to make this better with a combination of
                    your valuable input and our wonderful research team. We have a few goals in mind to give a
                    better experience at PinteReach. We are looking to make this a much easier experience by adding
                    a button that will automatically add your article to your collection. We also would like to
                    give more theme options so those who like personalization to their profile, can express themselves!
                    If you would like to contribute or have a suggestion, please feel free to contact us at our support
                    email address. Thank you for your interest in PinteReach!
